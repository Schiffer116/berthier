corps-new <name> <dir> [brief]      create a Corps workspace with a Main Agent
adopt <workspace> <corps>           make an existing workspace a Division of a Corps
board <corps> [--adopt <board-id>]  give a Corps its Board: an existing Skipli board, else a card on the Grand Army Board;
                                    the Main Loop hands its Main Agent new tasks added there (corps-new does this itself)
division-new <name> [--model <m>] [--artifact] <brief>
                                    (Main Agent) spawn a Division: a worktree workspace with its own Agent
                                    on --model (default $BERTHIER_DIVISION_MODEL, haiku); no Artifact unless --artifact
land <division>                     (Berthier) merge a Division of Berthier into master, check, rebuild, restart
                                    the changed services and wait until they work; refuses on conflict or failure
division-done <name>                (Main Agent) remove a spawned Division once the user reviewed it
report "<line>"                     (any Agent) one-line status for the user; "needs you: ..." when they must act
demo <url> [label]                (any Agent) where this Agent's demo or preview is hosted, shown in the Console's info panel;
                                    --clear [url] drops one (or all), --list prints them
ask <corps> "<request>"             (any Agent) request work from another Corps, delivered when it is idle
notify <corps> "<text>"             (service, no pane needed) one-way message to a Corps's Main Agent, no reply expected
shutdown [text]                     (the user's, army-wide) tell every Agent with a live pane (Frozen skipped) to wrap up: park, commit+push WIP, report, update notes
wake                                (the user's, army-wide) tell every such Agent to pick up where it left off, after a restart
prompt <pane> <text>|-              prompt the Agent in a pane and make sure Claude took it (not a bare herdr agent prompt);
                                    - reads the text from stdin
last <pane>                         the Claude Agent's latest assistant message, from its transcript (no pane read)
revive <pane>                       (the user's choice) resume a Frozen Agent's session anyway, rewriting its cache
fresh <pane>                        (the user's choice) a Fresh Start for a Frozen Agent: a new session in its pane, same model,
                                    rebuilt from its Corps's Notes, Board, last report and git (a Division: also its Brief)
notes [<corps>] [--set -]           a Corps's Notes (default: the caller's); --set - replaces them from stdin, refused if
                                    they changed since this Agent last read them (read again and merge)
owners                              who owns what, to know whom to ask
sample                              (status line) read session JSON on stdin, append to the quota ledger; silent, never fails
budget [<corps> <pct>|off]          weekly quota used vs allowance per Corps; set or drop one Corps's budget (% of the week)
profile [--waste] [--corps <c>] [--session <id>] [--week <n>]
                                    Spend of a quota week (JSON): Corps -> Division -> session, by model, token kind,
                                    cache hit and Turn origin, Spend per Delivered unit, ranked Waste signals;
                                    --waste: only the Waste signals, all of them; --session: that session's turns
counts                              Agent count per status plus reports, as JSON for status bars
log [-n lines] [-f]                 the Main Loop's event log, readable
army                                the full Grand Army view model as JSON (Corps, Divisions, Agents, asks, log)
dashboard [server args]             serve the live Grand Army console on 127.0.0.1:8430
hook-stop                           Claude Code Stop hook: a turn that ends unreported gets a report from its final message
tick                                run one Main Loop pass
loop                                run the Main Loop forever
